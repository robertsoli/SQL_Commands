## Temporary Tables

---

### Definition of a temporary table 

A temporary table is a base table that exists only for the duration of a specific database session and is not stored permanently in the database. It allows for the storage and manipulation of data during the session, providing better performance for repeated data usage compared to views.

### Some reasons to use temporary tables

- **Simplifying Complex Queries:** Breaking down complex queries into more manageable parts.
- **Improving Performance:** Avoiding repeated calculations by storing intermediate results.
- **Isolating Data for Testing:** Debugging and validating parts of your queries.
- **Storing Results for Subsequent Operations:** Facilitating further analysis and operations.
- **Facilitating ETL Processes:** Managing intermediate stages in data transformation.
- **Handling Large Data Sets:** Processing data in manageable chunks.
